# EpicQuestz Resource Packs

EpicQuestz uses different resource packs for different map regions.

## Why are there 4 packs?

When we create resource packs, we combine the relevant pack with the master pack (base). The master pack has universal textures; textures which are present in all 3 of our main resource packs. If you are adding a new texture, by default you should add it to the master pack.
The only cases where you shouldn't make a texture universal is where it truly is not applicable for a a specific region. In these cases, simply add it to the individual packs (addon).
