# EpicQuestz ResourcePacks
 The three RPs of EpicQuestz

## Why are there 4 packs?
 When we create resource packs, we combine the relevant pack with the Master Pack. The Master Pack has universal textures in: textures which are present in all 3 of our main resource packs. If you are adding a new texture, by default you should add it to the Master Pack.
 The only cases where you shouldn't make a texutre universal is where it truly is not applicable for a a specific resource pack. In these cases, simply add it to the individual packs.
